    <p><strong>Core Metrics</strong></p>
    <p>(1) The Equity Scorecard shall evaluate public institutions using the following core metrics—</p>
    <p>(a) <strong>Representation Ratio</strong> — Comparison of an institution’s ethnic composition to national demographics (based on the most recent census and calculated in accordance with the Fifth Schedule);</p>
    <p>(b) <strong>Leadership Equity</strong> — Representation of ethnic groups in leadership and decision-making roles, disaggregated by gender and disability;</p>
    <p>(c) <strong>Recruitment Equity</strong> — Diversity in new hires and promotions within the reporting year;</p>
    <p>(d) <strong>Service Delivery Equity</strong> — Geographic and demographic reach of services relative to the population served;</p>
    <p>(e) <strong>Trend Improvement</strong> — Year-on-year progress in metrics (a) to (d);</p>
    <p>(f) <strong>Transparency</strong> — Timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of data submissions, including responsiveness to audit queries.</p>

    <p><strong>Grading Scale</strong></p>
    <p>(2) The following grades shall be used to classify institutional performance—</p>

    <table class="table-auto border w-full text-sm">
      <thead>
        <tr class="bg-gray-100">
          <th class="border px-2 py-1 w-1/6">Grade</th>

        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td class="border px-2 py-1 font-bold">A</td><td class="border px-2 py-1">Exceeds benchmarks in all metrics. Demonstrates sustained improvement and proactive diversity measures.</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="border px-2 py-1 font-bold">B</td><td class="border px-2 py-1">Meets or exceeds benchmarks in most metrics; minor, correctable shortfalls in others.</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="border px-2 py-1 font-bold">C</td><td class="border px-2 py-1">Meets minimum legal thresholds but shows no measurable improvement.</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="border px-2 py-1 font-bold">D</td><td class="border px-2 py-1">Falls below minimum legal thresholds in multiple metrics; significant improvement required.</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="border px-2 py-1 font-bold">E</td><td class="border px-2 py-1">Persistent non-compliance or failure to submit required data.</td></tr>
      </tbody>
