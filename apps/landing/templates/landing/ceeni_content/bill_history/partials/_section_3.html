    <p>
      Ethnic identity has remained a central organising principle in Kenya’s political and administrative systems. While ethnicity is a legitimate marker of cultural identity, its politicisation has created patterns that distort governance and weaken national cohesion.
    </p>

    <h4>3.1 Ethnic Political Parties and “Kingpins”</h4>
    <p>
      Political parties often form around dominant ethnic leaders who negotiate power-sharing deals. These “kingpins” command bloc votes in exchange for Cabinet posts and public sector control.
    </p>

    <h4>3.2 Coalition Arithmetic</h4>
    <p>
      Winning elections relies on combining large ethnic blocs. These arrangements continue post-election, determining which communities get which ministries or parastatal appointments.
    </p>

    <h4>3.3 Cabinet and Senior Appointments as Political Rewards</h4>
    <p>
      High-level appointments serve as political currency. While appearing inclusive, these often benefit elite insiders rather than the wider community.
    </p>

    <h4>3.4 Marginalisation of “Non-Strategic” Communities</h4>
    <p>
      Communities seen as politically “weak” or scattered are frequently excluded from high-level posts, despite constitutional protections. They lack bargaining power in ethnic coalitions.
    </p>

    <h4>3.5 The Culture of Patronage and “Our Turn to Eat”</h4>
    <p>
      Public office is viewed as a reward. The informal mantra “ni wakati wetu wa kula” drives zero-sum politics, undermining national belonging and meritocracy.
    </p>

    <h4>3.6 Impact on Public Trust and National Cohesion</h4>
    <p>
      Ethnic bias in appointments erodes trust, fuels grievances, and destabilises elections. Many communities feel alienated from government, weakening Kenya’s cohesion.
