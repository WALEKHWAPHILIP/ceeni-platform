  </div>
  <div class="prose prose-gray max-w-none space-y-4">
    <p>
      From the moment Kenya gained independence in 1963, ethnic representation in government has been both a political bargaining chip and a flashpoint for national unity.
    </p>

    <h4>2.1 Early Independence Era (1963–1978)</h4>
    <p>
      Under President Jomo Kenyatta, the federal (“Majimbo”) structure was quickly dismantled. Power was centralised in the executive, and senior government positions increasingly reflected the President’s ethnic base.
    </p>

    <h4>2.2 Moi Era and “Ethnic Balancing” (1978–2002)</h4>
    <p>
      President Daniel arap Moi introduced informal ethnic balancing in Cabinet and top positions, rewarding loyalty rather than enforcing fairness.
      This entrenched elite-driven patronage networks, despite providing visibility for smaller groups.
    </p>

    <h4>2.3 Transition to Multiparty Politics (1991–2002)</h4>
    <p>
      Political parties formed along ethnic lines, relying on “kingpins” to deliver bloc votes in return for power-sharing and representation in state institutions.
    </p>

    <h4>2.4 Kibaki Era and Post-2007 Crisis (2002–2013)</h4>
    <p>
      After early merit-based reforms, President Kibaki’s administration regressed into ethnic favouritism.
      The disputed 2007 election led to violence and power-sharing through the National Accord and Grand Coalition Government, where appointments were split ethnically.
    </p>

    <h4>2.5 2010 Constitution – A New Legal Framework</h4>
    <p>
      The Constitution introduced values of inclusion and fairness (Articles 10, 27, 56, 232), but lacked statutory enforcement mechanisms to ensure proportional representation or penalise breaches.
    </p>

    <h4>2.6 Recent Developments (2013–2024)</h4>
    <p>
      Despite constitutional provisions, certain ethnic groups remain overrepresented in Cabinet, parastatals, and top offices. Coalition bargains persist, dividing state power based on bloc politics, undermining equality and inclusion.
