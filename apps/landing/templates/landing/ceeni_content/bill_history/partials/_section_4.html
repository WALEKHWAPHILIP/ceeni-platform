    <p>
      The politicisation of ethnicity has direct, measurable effects on how Kenyaâ€™s public sector is staffed, how it performs, and how citizens perceive its fairness.
    </p>

    <h4>4.1 Distorted Recruitment and Promotion</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Merit is diluted, lowering capability in technical and leadership roles.</li>
      <li>Career pathways skew toward those with political proximity.</li>
      <li>HR data becomes unreliable due to under-reporting or reclassification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.2 Institutional Capture and Policy Drift</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Boards and management align with factions, not the public interest.</li>
      <li>Coalition needs dictate policies, not service delivery outcomes.</li>
      <li>Leaders optimise for short-term cycles rather than long-term goals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.3 Inequitable Service Footprints</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Uneven allocation of projects and staffing across regions.</li>
      <li>Minority communities face barriers to accessing services.</li>
      <li>Trust deficits emerge in areas excluded from decision-making.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.4 Fiscal Inefficiencies</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Bloated wage bills and duplicated roles.</li>
      <li>Weakened procurement oversight increases risks.</li>
      <li>Corrective litigation and audits drain public resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.5 Erosion of Rule-of-Law Norms</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Legal requirements are treated as suggestions, not mandates.</li>
      <li>Whistleblowers are unprotected, silencing internal accountability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.6 Public Trust and Cohesion</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Hiring perceived as unfair breeds cynicism and resentment.</li>
      <li>Citizens disengage from governance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4.7 Why the EEPR Bill Changes This</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Introduces binding audits, data standards, and compliance orders.</li>
      <li>Mandates public transparency via dashboards and scorecards.</li>
      <li>Replaces coalition bargaining with algorithmic proportionality.</li>
      <li>Empowers citizen feedback through structured participation loops.</li>
    </ul>
