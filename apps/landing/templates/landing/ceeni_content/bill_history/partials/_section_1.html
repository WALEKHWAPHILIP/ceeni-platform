      The Ethnic Equity and Public Representation Bill, 2025 is born from decades of Kenya’s struggle to balance diversity with unity in public governance.
      Since independence in 1963, the country has grappled with persistent ethnic inequalities in political representation, public appointments, and resource allocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 set out transformative principles — including equality, inclusiveness, and protection of the marginalised —
      these ideals have not fully translated into practice. Recruitment and promotion in public institutions often reflect political bargaining,
      ethnic patronage, and regional power balances, rather than merit and proportional representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bill seeks to operationalise constitutional values by creating clear, measurable, and enforceable mechanisms to ensure that public institutions reflect the face of the nation.
      It is not a political tool but a governance framework: independent, data-driven, and anchored in law.

      This Historical Background sets out:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the historical roots of ethnic imbalance in public service;</li>
      <li>the patterns of political behaviour that sustain these inequalities;</li>
      <li>the cost to governance and social cohesion; and</li>
      <li>the rationale for a new, enforceable approach.</li>
    </ul>
