      Kenya’s journey since independence has been marked by resilience, diversity, and progress — but also by recurring struggles with ethnic imbalance in public representation. The persistence of these patterns, despite the transformative provisions of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, demonstrates a clear truth: good intentions without enforceable mechanisms are insufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ethnic Equity and Public Representation Bill, 2025 represents a decisive shift from aspiration to action. It is not a political instrument for any party or community, but a national governance safeguard — ensuring that every Kenyan, regardless of ethnicity, sees themselves reflected in the leadership of their country.
    </p>
    <p>
      By embedding clear targets, transparent data systems, binding oversight, and citizen participation, the Bill directly addresses the root causes of exclusion: informal patronage, opaque appointments, and lack of accountability. It replaces guesswork and bargaining with objective, fair, and lawful representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In doing so, it strengthens national cohesion, restores trust in public institutions, and affirms the promise of the Constitution — that public service belongs to all Kenyans equally.
    </p>
    <p class="font-semibold text-green-800">
      This is not merely a legal reform; it is an investment in national unity, stability, and fairness for generations to come. The time for implementation is now, before another electoral cycle entrenches the divisions we seek to heal.
