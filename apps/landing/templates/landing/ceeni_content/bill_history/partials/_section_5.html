    <p>
      Despite the strong equality and inclusivity provisions in the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, the absence of specific statutory enforcement mechanisms has allowed ethnic imbalance in public representation to persist.
    </p>

    <h4>5.1 Broad Constitutional Principles, Weak Operationalisation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Articles 10, 27, 56, and 232 require enabling legislation to become enforceable.</li>
      <li>No legal formula exists to turn the “face of Kenya” into measurable staffing targets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5.2 Dispersed Oversight, Limited Enforcement Power</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple agencies share partial mandates without unified enforcement power.</li>
      <li>Most can only issue recommendations, not binding corrective orders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5.3 Inadequate Data Standards and Transparency</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Staffing data is inconsistently collected and rarely published.</li>
      <li>Verification is difficult, and data is seldom tied to performance contracts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5.4 Lack of Consequences for Non-Compliance</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No statutory penalties for failing to ensure diversity in hiring.</li>
      <li>Enforcement through the courts is slow, fragmented, and inconsistent.</li>
      <li>Whistleblower protections are weak, discouraging internal reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5.5 Political Incentives Against Reform</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Patronage systems benefit political elites and discourage change.</li>
      <li>Without timelines and enforcement, voluntary compliance is unreliable.</li>
    </ul>
