      The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 stands as the most transformative legal and political document in the country’s history.
      It emerged from decades of struggle, public demand, and reform — and replaced a system that had long concentrated power, enabled exclusion, and failed to protect the rights of all citizens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anchored in the values of <strong>democracy, inclusion, devolution, social justice,</strong> and <strong>human rights</strong>, the Constitution is not merely a legal text —
      it is a social contract that defines who we are as a people and what we owe to one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every Kenyan should know this document. It is the foundation of public life, the basis of all government authority,
      and the primary reference for fairness, equity, and dignity in how we govern and treat each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>This page helps you reconnect with that foundation —</strong>
      offering a short summary and direct access to the full Constitution for you to read, share, and uphold.
