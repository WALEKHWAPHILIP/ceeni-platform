      The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 is built on principles that reflect the nation’s deepest aspirations. Below are some of the key features every citizen should understand:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>Devolution of Power:</strong> Authority is shared between the national and 47 county governments, bringing services, accountability, and leadership closer to the people.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bill of Rights:</strong> A comprehensive set of rights and freedoms that protect every individual regardless of ethnicity, gender, religion, or background — enshrined in Chapter Four.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leadership and Integrity:</strong> Chapter Six sets high moral and ethical standards for all public officers to combat corruption and promote accountability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inclusivity and Equity:</strong> The Constitution demands representation, fairness, and the protection of marginalized groups — laying the foundation for ethnic and gender inclusion in public institutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Participatory Democracy:</strong> Kenyans have the right to participate in decision-making processes at all levels — through voting, petitions, referenda, and public consultation.
      </li>
    </ul>
