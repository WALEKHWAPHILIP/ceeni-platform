          <strong class="text-red-700">The EEPR Bill, 2025 is more than a piece of legislation</strong>.
          It is a turning point in Kenya's journey toward fairness, unity, and national dignity.
          For decades, public service in Kenya has too often been shaped by tribal capture, political bargaining, and a winner-takes-all mentality. 
          The result? Communities left out. Talented citizens overlooked. Institutions seen as serving some, but not all.
          The EEPR Bill changes this story; not with promises, but with 
          binding rules, transparent data, and real enforcement.
          These are the nine civic transformations that the Bill will deliver: 
          each one a shift from old habits that divide us, to new norms that unite us. 
          Together, they redefine public service as a national trust that belongs equally to all Kenyans.

          For years, winning national elections was treated like winning a prize for one community:
          top jobs flowed to the tribe in power while others felt like outsiders in their own country.
          The EEPR Bill ends this zero-sum game by redefining public service as a national trust - 
          not a political reward. Each group's share of public jobs aligns with its population - no more,
          no less - so ministries, counties, and agencies mirror Kenya's true diversity. As representation
          becomes fair and visible from Turkana to Taita-Taveta and Mandera to Migori, trust in the state
          grows - and unity follows.

          Too often campaigns have been poisoned by ethnic fearmongering: “If they win, you lose.”
          With CEENI in place and appointments governed by a transparent formula, public jobs can't be
          traded as tribal rewards. That takes away the fuel for incitement. Politicians must compete
          on schools, healthcare, roads, and youth opportunities - on solutions, not surnames. When elections
          are about ideas and delivery, Kenya wins.

        <p>
          The mindset of “ni wakati wetu wa kula” turns government into a feast for a few and leaves
          millions outside the door. The EEPR Bill breaks that cycle by guaranteeing proportional
          representation in public offices. Small tribes gain a permanent seat at the table; large tribes
          remain represented - through merit and fairness, not political loyalty. Whether El Molo or Luhya,
          Pokomo or Kikuyu, every Kenyan belongs in public service. Fair access becomes a lawful
          entitlement - not a favour from those in power.

        <p>
          Token appointments can't hide skewed departments. The EEPR Bill replaces optics with evidence:
          every public body must publish staffing by ethnicity, gender, and other indicators; the KPEID
          Dashboard exposes the numbers; and annual Equity Scorecards rate compliance. With measurable,
          public data, inclusivity becomes a standard that can be verified and enforced - not just claimed.

      <div class="prose prose-gray max-w-none">
        <p>
          Unity speeches are not enough. The EEPR Bill gives CEENI power to audit every public body,
          issue compliance orders with deadlines, and impose penalties for ignoring the law - grounding
          Article 10's values in enforceable practice. If an institution is over-represented, it must fix
          the imbalance. True unity becomes a legal duty, not a rhetorical flourish.

        <p>
          Some careers have thrived on dividing Kenyans and warning of doom if “they” take power.
          By removing public offices as tribal prizes, the EEPR Bill undercuts the payoff for stoking fear.
          Leaders must compete on vision, policy, and results. The public square shifts from threats to
          possibility - hope replacing suspicion.

          The EEPR Bill restores power to the people through the KPEID Dashboard and CEENI Citizen
          Reporting Portal: anyone can check compliance, report violations safely and anonymously, and
          track corrective actions. Democracy becomes continuous oversight - not just a vote every five years.

          Young Kenyans have watched opportunities go to the “right” last names. The EEPR Bill levels the

          Garissa has the same shot as one from Kericho or Kiambu. Your skills and commitment - not your

          Politics has long reduced governance to post-election sharing: how many ministries, parastatals,
          and posts each bloc gets. The EEPR Bill ends the shadow bargaining. Every institution must publish
          its staffing composition, measure it against the proportional formula, and correct imbalances on
          a set timeline. CEENI tracks, verifies, and reports publicly, shifting focus from “What did our
          side get?” to “Is our public service fair and effective for everyone?”

        The EEPR Bill is a reset - from exclusion to inclusion, division to dignity, promises to proof.
        These nine transformations are practical and enforceable; they will touch every ministry,
        county, and public office. This is not about helping one group over another - it's about a Kenya
        where every citizen belongs, every community is respected, and every institution reflects the
        face of the nation. Fairness isn't a favour - it's a right. The time to claim it is now.
