      Kenya’s strength is in our people — every tribe, every language, every culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      For too long, our differences have been used to divide us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s time to turn our diversity into our greatest advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Ethnic Equity and Public Representation Bill, 2025</strong> is our chance to make sure
      that public service truly belongs to all Kenyans.
    </p>
    <p><strong>This is about fairness.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This is about unity.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>This is about building a country where every child can dream without limits.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Let’s make history — together.<br>
      <strong>Support the Bill. Stand for fairness. Strengthen Kenya.</strong>
