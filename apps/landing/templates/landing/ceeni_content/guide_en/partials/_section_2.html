    <p>
      Right now, public jobs in Kenya are not shared fairly among all communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of following clear rules, appointments often depend on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Political deals made after elections.</li>
      <li>Ethnic loyalty, where leaders favour people from their own community.</li>
      <li>Patronage systems — “if we win, our people eat.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This means some communities get more than their fair share of positions, while others are left out completely.
    </p>
    <p>The result?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Good people are overlooked just because they come from the “wrong” tribe.</li>
      <li>Some communities lose trust in government because they feel excluded.</li>
      <li>Services suffer because jobs are not always given to the most qualified people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Kenya’s 2010 Constitution calls for inclusivity and fairness in public service —
      but without a clear formula and strong enforcement, these values remain only words on paper.
