      Kenya is home to more than 40 different ethnic communities, each with its own history, culture, and strengths.
      Our diversity is our greatest national asset — but for decades, it has also been used in politics to divide us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too often, who gets a public job or leadership position depends on political deals and ethnic loyalty,
      instead of fairness and merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Ethnic Equity and Public Representation Bill, 2025</strong> is about changing that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes sure that every Kenyan — no matter their ethnic background — has a fair chance to serve in public institutions,
      and that those institutions reflect the face of Kenya.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a political promise. It is a <strong>binding law</strong> that will set clear rules,
      track results publicly, and hold leaders accountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When public offices belong to all of us, <strong>trust grows</strong>, <strong>services improve</strong>,
      and <strong>unity becomes real</strong>.
