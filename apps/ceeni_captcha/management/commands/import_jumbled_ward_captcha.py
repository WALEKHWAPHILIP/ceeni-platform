FILE: apps/ceeni_captcha/management/commands/import_jumbled_ward_captcha.py

PURPOSE:
    Concrete management command to import jumbled ward captcha data from
    `jumbled_ward_captcha.csv` into the JumbledWardCaptcha model.
    This leverages the generic base command `BaseImportCaptchaCommand`.

CSV REQUIRED (relative to your project root):
    data/csv/captcha/jumbled_ward_captcha.csv

CSV STRUCTURE:
    question_text,correct_answer,hint,explanation,difficulty,tags,active

USAGE:
    python manage.py import_jumbled_ward_captcha

NOTES:
    - Idempotent: rows are matched by a slug derived from the first 80 chars of `question_text`.
      Existing rows are updated; new ones are created.
    - Booleans in CSVâ€™s 'active' column should be TRUE/FALSE (case-insensitive).
